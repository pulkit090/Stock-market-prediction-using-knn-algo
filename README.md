Stock Market Prediction using k-NN Algorithm

This repository is dedicated to predicting stock market prices using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The project aims to understand the working principles of k-NN and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by applying them to the domain of stock market prediction.

Overview
In this project, we utilize the k-NN algorithm to forecast stock market prices. k-NN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that works on the principle of finding the 'nearest' neighbors in the feature space. In the context of stock market prediction, k-NN identifies similar historical data points (stocks) and uses them to predict future price movements.

Working of k-NN
Distance Calculation: For a given data point (stock), the distance to all other data points in the dataset is calculated. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, etc.

Nearest Neighbors Selection: The k-NN algorithm selects the 'k' nearest neighbors based on the calculated distances.

Prediction: For regression tasks like stock price prediction, the algorithm computes the average (or weighted average) of the target values of the 'k' nearest neighbors. This value is then assigned as the predicted price for the target stock.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RMSE is a commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of regression models, including k-NN. It measures the average deviation of predicted values from the actual values. The lower the RMSE, the better the model performance.

Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the working principles of k-NN and RMSE through hands-on application in the domain of stock market prediction. By working on this project, contributors can deepen their understanding of:

How k-NN algorithm works, including its strengths and limitations.
The significance of choosing appropriate features and hyperparameters in k-NN.
How to evaluate the performance of regression models using RMSE.
Practical considerations and challenges in applying machine learning techniques to real-world financial data.
